            <p>After high school, I took a gap year. I had no idea what I wanted to do, and the thought of going to college and trying to figure out what I wanted to do for the rest of my life seemed all but impossible. So, I took the year off from school and became a “professional” ski bum. It wasn’t glamorous, I worked a ton of odd jobs, and I spent more nights on hard cold floors than I care to remember. </p>
            <p><span>Was it all worth it looking back over 20 years later?</span></p> 
            <p>There is not a shred of doubt in my mind that I made the correct decision! I met some of the most interesting people to ever cross my path in life. I saw the true kindness of humanity out there. I made friendships that have weathered the test of time, and I learned more about myself within that year than the previous 19 combined. (I also became a decent freestyle skier in the process).</p>

            <p>I try to take a ski trip somewhere each year to relax and recharge my internal batteries. I try to remind myself how this journey started all those years ago.</p>
